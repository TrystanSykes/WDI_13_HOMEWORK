Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.  
(If you're looking for a WordPress framework, check out <a href="https://reduxframework.com">Redux Framework</a>.)  
  
    
 It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server and native), and
 are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as <a href="#">live code editing with a time travelling debugger</a>.  
   
You can use Redux together with <a href="https://reactjs.net/">React</a>, or with any other view library.  
It is tiny (2kB including dependencies).

### Developer Experience  
  
I wrote redux while working on my React Europe talk called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs/">"Hot Reloading with Time Travel"</a>. My goal was to create a state management library with minimal API but completely predictable behavior, so it is possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.
